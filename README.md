# rclone-python ☁️

A python wrapper for rclone that makes rclone's functionality usable in python.
rclone needs to be installed on the system for the wrapper to work.

![demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Johannes11833/rclone_python/master/demo/demo.gif)

## Features ⚒️

- Copy, move and sync files between remotes
- Delete and prune files/directories
- List files in a directory including properties of the files.
- List available remotes.
- Generate hashes from files or validate them with their hashsum.
- Create new remotes
- Check available remotes
- Create and manage public links.
- Check the currently installed rclone versions and if updates are available.

## Installation 💾

_rclone_python_ can be installed using pip

```shell
pip install rclone-python
```

or by cloning this repository and running from within the root of the project

```shell
pip install .
```

## How to use 💡

All functionally of this wrapper is accessible through `rclone`.
The following example checks if rclone is installed.

```python
from rclone_python import rclone

print(rclone.is_installed())
```

```console
True
```
### Create new remote

Create a new rclone remote connection with rclone's default client-id and client-secret.

```python
from rclone_python import rclone
from rclone_python.remote_types import RemoteTypes

rclone.create_remote('onedrive', RemoteTypes.onedrive)
```

Additionally, client-id and client-secret can be used with many cloud providers.

```python
from rclone_python import rclone
from rclone_python.remote_types import RemoteTypes

rclone.create_remote('onedrive', RemoteTypes.onedrive, client_id='YOUR_CLIENT_ID', client_secret='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET')
```

### Copy

```python
from rclone_python import rclone

# copy all file in the test_dir on OneDrive to the local data folder.
rclone.copy('onedrive:data', 'data', ignore_existing=True, args=['--create-empty-src-dirs'])
```


```console
Copying onedrive:data to data ⠸ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  47% 110.0/236.5 MiB 0:00:04
 ├─video1.webm                ⠸ ━━━━━━━━━━━━╺━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  31% 24.4/78.8 MiB   0:00:06
 ├─video2.webm                ⠸ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╺━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  45% 35.5/78.8 MiB   0:00:03
 └─video3.webm                ⠸ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  35% 27.6/78.8 MiB   0:00:05
```

### Delete

Delete a file or a directory. When deleting a directory, only the files in the directory (and all it's subdirectories)
are deleted, but the folders remain.

```python
from rclone_python import rclone

# delete a specific file on onedrive
rclone.delete('onedrive:data/video1.mp4')

```

### Prune

```python
from rclone_python import rclone

# remove the entire test_dir folder (and all files contained in it and it's subdirectories) on onedrive
rclone.purge('onedrive:test_dir')
```

### Get Hash
```python
from rclone_python import rclone
from rclone_python.hash_types import HashTypes

print(rclone.hash(HashTypes.sha1, "box:data")
```
```console
{'video1.webm': '3ef08d895f25e8b7d84d3a1ac58f8f302e33058b', 'video3.webm': '3ef08d895f25e8b7d84d3a1ac58f8f302e33058b', 'video2.webm': '3ef08d895f25e8b7d84d3a1ac58f8f302e33058b'}
```

### Check
Checks the files in the source and destination match.
  - "=" path means path was found in source and destination and was identical
  - "-" path means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
  - "+" path means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
  - "*" path means path was present in source and destination but different.
  - "!" path means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.
```python
from rclone_python import rclone

print(rclone.check("data", "box:data"))
```
```console
(False, [('*', 'video1.webm'), ('=', 'video2.webm'), ('=', 'video2.webm')])
```

### Custom config file
You can define a custom file which rclone shall use by setting it up before running any command.
Example with a config file named ".rclone.conf" in current working directory:
```python
import pathlib
from rclone_python import rclone

CONFIG_FILE = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / ".rclone.conf"

rclone.set_config_file(CONFIG_FILE)
# All upcoming rclone commands will use custom config file
```

## Custom Progressbar
You can use your own rich progressbar with all transfer operations.
This allows you to customize the columns to be displayed.
A list of all rich-progress columns can be found [here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html#columns).

```python
from rclone_python import rclone

from rich.progress import (
    Progress,
    TextColumn,
    BarColumn,
    TaskProgressColumn,
    TransferSpeedColumn,
)

pbar = Progress(
    TextColumn("[progress.description]{task.description}"),
    BarColumn(),
    TaskProgressColumn(),
    TransferSpeedColumn(),
)
rclone.copy("data", "box:rclone_test/data1", pbar=pbar)
```

```console
Copying data to data1 ━━━━━━╸━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  17% 5.3 MB/s                                                                                                            
 ├─video1.mp4         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╺━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  38% 4.2 MB/s                                                                                                            
 ├─video2.mp4         ━╸━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   5% 1.6 MB/s
 └─another.mp4        ━╸━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   4% 1.4 MB/s
```

## Set the log level
The log level can be set using: 
```python
rclone.set_log_level(logging.DEBUG)
```
This will make the wrapper print the raw rclone progress.
